The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, referred to as the Affordable Care Act or ACA for short, is the comprehensive health care reform law enacted in March 2010.
The law has 3 primary goals:",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_2,"Make affordable health insurance available to more people.
The law provides consumers with subsidies (premium tax credits) that lower costs for households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL).
Expand the Medicaid program to cover all adults with income below 138% of the FPL.
Not all states have expanded their Medicaid programs.
Support innovative medical care delivery methods designed to lower the costs of health care generally.
Pre-Existing Conditions
Health insurance companies cannot refuse coverage or charge you more just because you have a pre-existing condition  that is, a health problem you had before the date that new health coverage starts.
Health insurers can no longer charge more or deny coverage to you or your child because of a pre-existing health condition like asthma, diabetes, or cancer, as well as pregnancy.
They cannot limit benefits for that condition either.
Once you have insurance, they can't refuse to cover treatment for your pre-existing condition.
Exceptions
Grandfathered health plans do not have to cover pre-existing conditions.
Young Adult Coverage
If your parents plan covers dependents, you usually can get added to or stay on your parents health plan until you turn 26 years old.

Your coverage will end on your 26th birthday.
When you lose coverage on your 26th birthday, you qualify for a Special Enrollment Period.
This lets you enroll in a health plan outside Open Enrollment.
Cancellations & Appeals
Insurance Cancellations
Insurance companies can no longer cancel your coverage just because you or your employer made a mistake on your insurance application.
Previously, insurance companies could take away your coverage, declare your policy invalid, and ask you to pay back any money they had spent on your medical care.
These protections apply to all health plans, including grandfathered plans, whether you get coverage through your employer or buy it yourself.
Can my insurance still get cancelled?
Your insurance company can cancel your coverage if you intentionally put false or incomplete information on your insurance application.
Your insurance company can cancel your coverage if you fail to pay your premiums on time.
Your insurance company notify you at least 30 days before they can cancel your coverage, giving you time to appeal the decision or find new coverage.
Appealing Health Plan Decisions
If your health insurer refuses to pay a claim or ends your coverage, you have the right to appeal the decision and have it reviewed by a third party.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_4,"You can ask that your insurance company reconsider its decision.
Insurers have to tell you why theyve denied your claim or ended your coverage.
And they must let you know how you can dispute their decisions.
Two Ways to Appeal
There are two ways to appeal a health plan decision:
Internal appeal: If your claim is denied or your health insurance coverage canceled, you have the right to an internal appeal.
You may ask your insurance company to conduct a full and fair review of its decision.
If the case is urgent, your insurance company must speed up this process.
External review: You have the right to take your appeal to an independent third party for review.
This is called external review.
External review means that the insurance company no longer gets the final say over whether to pay a claim.
Help is Available
Your state may have a Consumer Assistance Program that can help you file an appeal or request a review of your health insurance companys decision if you are not sure what steps to take.
If you have questions about internal appeals and external reviews, call your health plan or state insurance regulator .

Since its enactment on March 23, 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has led to an historic advancement of health equity in the United States.
Thanks to the ACA, millions of Americans have gained health coverage without lifetime limits, and protections are in place for people with preexisting conditions.
People have access to essential health benefits, including preventive and rehabilitative care, prescription drugs, wellness visits and contraceptives, and mental health and substance use treatment, among many others.

Lawfully present immigrants may qualify for Medicaid and CHIP but are subject to certain eligibility restrictions.
In general, lawfully present immigrants must have a qualified immigration status to be eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, and many, including most lawful permanent residents or green card holders, must wait five years after obtaining qualified status before they may enroll.
Some immigrants with qualified status, such as refugees and asylees, do not have to wait five years before enrolling.
Some immigrants, such as those with temporary protected status, are lawfully present but do not have a qualified status and are not eligible to enroll in Medicaid or CHIP regardless of their length of time in the country.
For children and pregnant people, states can eliminate the five-year wait and extend coverage to lawfully present immigrants without a qualified status.
As of January 2022, 35 states have taken up this option for children and half have elected the option for pregnant individuals.""
""In December 2020, Congress restored Medicaid eligibility for citizens of Compact of Free Association (COFA) communities.

Lawfully present immigrants can purchase coverage through the ACA Marketplaces and may receive tax credits for this coverage.
Like citizens, they can get tax credits to help pay for premiums and cost sharing that vary on a sliding scale based on income.
Generally, these tax credits are available to people with incomes starting from 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) who are not eligible for other affordable coverage.
In addition, lawfully present immigrants with incomes below 100% FPL may receive tax credits if they are ineligible for Medicaid based on immigration status.
This group includes lawfully present immigrants who are not eligible for Medicaid or CHIP because they are in the five-year waiting period or do not have a qualified status.""
""Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in Medicaid or CHIP or to purchase coverage through the ACA Marketplaces.

Since 2002, states have had the option to provide prenatal care to people regardless of immigration status by extending CHIP coverage to the unborn child.
As of January 2022, 18 states had adopted this option.

Eligibility for ACA Coverage Among Uninsured Immigrants""
""Eligibility for ACA Coverage Among Uninsured Immigrants
Many uninsured lawfully present immigrants are eligible for coverage options under the ACA but remain uninsured, while uninsured undocumented immigrants are ineligible for coverage options.
Prior to the pandemic, many uninsured lawfully present immigrants were eligible for ACA coverage through Medicaid or the ACA Marketplaces.
ARPA, enacted in 2021, further increased access to health coverage through temporary increases and expansions in eligibility for subsidies to buy health insurance through the health insurance Marketplaces and these enhanced subsidies will continue through 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
With the temporary changes under ARPA and IRA, approximately three-quarters (77%) of uninsured lawfully present immigrants were eligible for coverage, including 28% who were eligible for Medicaid and 49% who were eligible for ACA subsidies (Figure 6).

Many lawfully present immigrants who are eligible for coverage remain uninsured because immigrant families face a range of enrollment barriers, including fear, confusion about eligibility policies, difficulty navigating the enrollment process, and language and literacy challenges.
Research suggests that changes to immigration policy made by the Trump Administration contributed to growing fears among immigrant families about enrolling themselves and/or their children in Medicaid and CHIP even if they were eligible.
In particular, changes to the public charge policy likely contributed to decreases in participation in Medicaid among immigrant families and their primarily U.S.-born children.
The Biden Administration reversed many of these changes, including the changes to public charge policy, and has increased investments in outreach and enrollment assistance, which may facilitate increased enrollment of eligible uninsured immigrants.

In December 2022, CMS approved a State Innovation Waiver from Washington that will allow all state residents regardless of immigration status to enroll in qualified health and dental plans through the state Marketplace and to benefit from state-funded subsidies effective January 1, 2024; the waiver does not affect eligibility for federally-funded subsidies.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023

However, even with increased eligibility and enhanced outreach and enrollment assistance, it will likely require time and sustained work, including community-led efforts, to rebuild trust and reduce fears among immigrant families about accessing health coverage and care.
Addressing the needs of immigrants is of growing importance as the pandemic has likely worsened the health and financial challenges faced by immigrants and there has been increasing immigration activity in the border region.

In addition to APTC, consumers with projected annual household incomes between 100  and 250  of the FPL will
qualify for extra savings that lower the amount they will have to pay to meet deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance
(CSRs).",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_28,"(CSRs).
If a consumer qualifies CSRs, the consumer generally must enroll in a Silver plan to get the extra savings (e.g.,
reduced costs for hospitalizations, doctor office visits, prescription drugs).
Consumers wishing to maximize their overall
savings should be reminded that they are more likely to experience unexpected costs when they seek care if they have a
Bronze plan compared to a plan at a higher metal level.
Healthy consumers with incomes at the higher-end of CSR
eligibility may not see the value in CSR out-of-pocket savings, due to their potential for lower utilization of coverage.""
""Therefore, agents and brokers should help consumers understand how they would pay for a large, unexpected medical
cost, like a hospitalization.
Walking consumers through such a scenario would help CSR-eligible consumers see the
overall value of enrolling in a Silver plan.
What Employers Need to Know About the Rule Change
For Affordability of Employer Coverage for Family Members of
Employees For Purposes of Eligibility for the Premium Tax Credit
The rule that defines for purposes of eligibility for the premium tax credit (PTC) whether an offer of employersponsored health coverage is affordable has changed.

Background
Consumers who enroll in a Qualified Health Plan

savings through PTC and or cost sharing reductions
(CSRs).
Under the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act (ACA), a consumer who has an offer of
employer-sponsored coverage does not qualify
for any of these financial assistance options unless
the offer of coverage is considered unaffordable or
fails to meet a minimum value standard.
For 2023,
a plan is considered unaffordable if the plans
premiums exceed 9.12 percent of the employees
household income.
This percentage is referred to as
the Required Contribution Percentage (RCP).

The new rule on affordability of employer coverage for the family members of employees
changes how affordability is calculated for employees family members and increases the number of
consumers who have access to financial assistance through the Marketplace.

How Long Can a Consumer Stay on COBRA?
When consumers elect COBRA continuation coverage due to termination of employment or a reduction
of hours, they are generally allowed up to an additional 18 months of group health coverage.
o In certain circumstances, consumers may extend COBRA continuation coverage up to an additional
36 months of group health coverage.
Extensions:
o Dependents of a covered employee who becomes eligible for Medicare.
o If a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits and later has a termination of
employment or a reduction of employment hours, the period of COBRA continuation coverage for
the employee's spouse and dependent children lasts until the later of the 36-month period that
begins on the date the covered employee became entitled to Medicare, or the 18- or 29-month
period that begins on the date of the covered employee's termination of employment or reduction
of employment hours.
o Disability: Additional 11 months for a total of 29 months.

Q: What is the health insurance Marketplace?,""A: Health Insurance Marketplaces (also known as Exchanges) are organizations set up to create more organized and competitive markets for buying health insurance.
They offer a choice of different health plans, certify plans that participate, and provide information and in-person assistance to help consumers understand their options and apply for coverage.
Through the Marketplace, individuals and families can shop for coverage if they need to buy health insurance on their own.
Premium and cost sharing subsidies based on income are available through the Marketplace to make coverage affordable for individuals and families.
People with very low incomes can also find out at the Marketplace if they are eligible for coverage through Medicaid and CHIP.
Finally, small businesses can buy coverage for their employees through Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace plans.There is a health insurance Marketplace in every state for individuals and families and for small businesses.
Some are operated by the State and have a special state name (such as CoveredCalifornia or The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange.)
In other states where the federal government runs the Marketplace, it is called HealthCare.gov.""

Q: Im eligible for health benefits at work but want to see if I can get a better deal in the Marketplace.
Can I do that?,""A: You can always shop for coverage on the Marketplace, assuming you meet other eligibility requirements, but if you have access to job-based coverage, you might not qualify for premium tax credits.""

Q: What health plans are offered through the Marketplace?,""A: All health plans offered through the Marketplace must meet the requirements of qualified health plans.

Q: Will covered benefits under all Marketplace plans be the same?
How can I compare?,""A: Not necessarily.
All Marketplace health plans are required to cover the ten categories of essential health benefits.
However, insurers in many states will have flexibility to modify coverage for some of the specific services within each category.
Any modifications must be approved by the Marketplace before plans can be offered.

""Q: I notice Marketplace plans are labeled Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. What does that mean?

Cost sharing refers to health plan deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance.
For most covered services, you will have to pay (or share) some of the cost, at least until you reach the annual out of pocket limit on cost sharing.
The exception is for preventive health services, which health plans must cover entirely.

Catastrophic plans have the highest cost sharing.
In 2023, Catastrophic plans will have an annual deductible of $9,100 ($18,200 in family plans).
You will have to pay the entire cost of covered services (other than preventive care) until youve spent $9,100 out of pocket; after that your plan will pay 100 percent of covered in-network services for the rest of the year.
Not everybody will be allowed to buy Catastrophic plans.

Q: What happens if I need care from a doctor who isnt in my plans network?,""A: In general, plans are not required to cover care received from a non-network provider, though there are important exceptions.
All plans are required to cover emergency services that you receive out-of-network and apply in-network cost-sharing.
In addition, it is now illegal for out-of-network hospitals, doctors, and other providers (other than ground ambulance) to bill you more than the in-network cost sharing amount for out-of-network emergency services.
Instead, they are required to submit claims directly to your health plan, find out the amount of in-network cost sharing you owe, and bill you for no more than that amount.
In addition, all plans must now cover out-of-network surprise bills for non-emergency services that you receive while you are at an in-network hospital or other facility, and apply in-network cost-sharing.
These so-called surprise medical bills can arise when an out-of-network provider whom you did not pick (such as an anesthesiologist) also takes part in your care.

Most marketplace plans are HMOs and generally require that you get care from in-network providers in order for claims to be covered.
A small number of marketplace plans are so-called PPOs and will provide some coverage for care received out-of-network.
However, it could be costly to you because your plan will probably cover less of the bill than it would for in-network services.
In addition, the non-network providers dont have to limit their charges to an amount the insurer says is reasonable, so you might also owe balance billing expenses (the difference between what your plan pays and the providers full charge.)
If you went out of network because you felt it was medically necessary to receive care from a specific professional or facility  for example, if you felt your plans network didnt include providers able to provide the care you need  and if your plan denies coverage, you can appeal the insurers decision.

Q: Is dental coverage an essential health benefit?,""A: Under the health care law, dental insurance is treated differently for adults and children 18 and under.

To compute a family premium, insurers will add together a separate premium for each adult age 21 and older.
In addition, insurers can charge a separate premium for up to three children under age 21.
In your example, your family premium will reflect three adult premiums and three child premiums.""
Q: I smoke cigarettes and I buy my own health insurance.
Can I be charged more because I smoke?,""A: Yes, in most states you can.
Insurers are allowed to increase premiums by up to 50% more for people who use tobacco, although many insurers apply a lower surcharge for tobacco use.
If you qualify for premium tax credits, this tobacco surcharge will not be covered by the tax credit.

Q: I dont have a checking account.
Can the insurance company require that I get one and pay my premiums through automatic monthly withdrawals?,""A: No.
Insurers offering coverage in the individual-market exchange or Marketplace are required to provide a variety of payment methods and cannot require a consumer to pay by automatic bank withdrawals (sometimes called electronic funds transfers, or EFT.)
Federal rules require the insurer to accept paper checks, cashiers checks, money orders, and all general-purpose pre-paid debit cards, as well as EFT.

Q: Can my brother (or my church or another third party) pay my portion of the monthly health insurance premium for me?,""A: Possibly.

Q: What happens if Im late with a monthly health insurance premium payment?,""A: The answer depends on whether you are receiving advanced premium tax credits.
For people receiving advanced premium tax credits, if a payment due date is missed, insurers must provide a 90-day grace period during which consumers can bring their premium payments up to date and avoid having their coverage terminated.
However, the grace period only applies if an individual has paid at least one months premium.
If, by the end of the 90-day grace period, the amount owed for all outstanding premium payments is not paid in full, the insurer can terminate coverage.
In addition, during the first 30 days of the grace period, the insurer must continue to pay claims.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_96,"However, after the first 30 days of the grace period, the insurer can hold off paying any health care claims for care received during the grace period, which means the enrollee may be responsible to cover any health care services they receive during the second and third months if they fail to catch up on the amounts they owe before the end of the grace period.
Insurers are supposed to inform health care providers when someones claims are being held.
This could mean that providers will not provide care until the premiums are paid up so that they know they will be paid.
People not receiving advanced premium tax credits are expected to get a much shorter grace period; currently, the general practice is 31 days but it may vary in each state.
Note that insurers are no longer allowed to require people who owe back-due premiums from the past 12 months to repay the premium debt before they will renew or sell you new coverage for the year.
States can prohibit or limit this practice by insurers.

In some cases, an insurer may stop offering a particular policy and offer you new choices, instead.
Shortly before Open Enrollment begins, you should receive a notice from your insurance company describing any changes to your policy and the new monthly premium.
If you want to continue the policy you can renew coverage for another year.
If you prefer to shop for other coverage, you can do that during Open Enrollment.""
Q: I signed up for Marketplace coverage last year and I want to continue in this plan for another year.
Do I have to do anything during Open Enrollment?,""A: Even if you like your current coverage, it is strongly advised that you take steps to actively renew it during Open Enrollment.
If you are receiving a premium tax credit, when you actively renew you can also update your income and family information and see how much tax credit you may be eligible for based on the new premiums for the coming year.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_103,"Even if your circumstances have not changed, new insurers might join the Marketplace or expand their service areas for 2023, and this could affect the amount of subsidy available for your plan next year.
In most states, Open Enrollment for 2023 plans begins on November 1, 2022 and ends January 15, 2023.
If you dont take any action by December 15, in most cases the Marketplace will automatically renew your coverage for the coming year.
However, insurers may not offer all of the same plans next year that they offered this year.
If your health plan will no longer be offered next year and you do nothing, your insurance company will automatically enroll you in another policy that is similar to the one you have currently.
The automatic renewal process may work differently in some state-run Marketplaces.""
""Q: I intended to shop for new coverage for next year but didnt get around to it on time.
Meanwhile, the Marketplace automatically renewed my current policy for another year.
Can I still make a change?
"",""A: Yes, you can.
If you live in a HealthCare.gov state, Open Enrollment for 2023 coverage ends on January 15, 2023.
If you were auto-renewed by the Marketplace in December but still want to change plans, you can make changes until the end of Open Enrollment.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023

State-run Marketplaces can set different dates for Open Enrollment and several have done so.
Check with your state Marketplace for more information.""
Q: The notice from my insurer indicates that my plan wont be offered again next year.
Now what do I do?,""A: During Open Enrollment, you can shop for a different plan.
If your insurance company wont offer any other Marketplace plans next year, you should sign up for new coverage during Open Enrollment in order to remain insured next year and receive the most accurate premium tax credit possible.
If you dont act by the end of Open Enrollment and you live in a HealthCare.gov state, the Marketplace will automatically enroll you in a new plan offered by a different insurance company.
The Marketplace will try to pick the lowest cost plan that is as similar as possible to the one you have now.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_105,"If your insurance company is discontinuing your plan but will continue to offer other plans, and if you live in a HealthCare.gov state, your choices are similar:  you can shop for a new plan during Open Enrollment, or you can do nothing and your insurance company will automatically enroll you in the lowest cost plan it offers for next year that is similar to what you had this year.
The notice you received from your insurer should describe that alternative plan and how it differs from your current plan.""
Q: My insurance company wont offer any plans on the Marketplace next year.
Do I qualify for a special enrollment period?,""A: Yes.
However, if possible, follow the regular Open Enrollment process and deadlines to pick a new plan for next year.
If you pick a new plan during Open Enrollment and pay your January premium by the deadline the new insurer requires, then coverage under your new plan will take effect January 1.
Your current insurers exit from the Marketplace at the end of this year is considered a qualifying event that also makes you eligible for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP).
Therefore, you could use the SEP process instead to pick a new plan for next year.
This process can give you more time to make a plan selection, but it may also require additional steps and verifications and even result in a gap in coverage.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_106,"Under the SEP process you can elect new coverage any time during the 60 days leading up to your qualifying event date (January 1).
If you pick a new plan during this time (as late as December 31), you can also request that new coverage take effect on January 1, the day after your current coverage ends.
This is one key difference between the SEP and Open Enrollment processes.
Through Open Enrollment, in most states, you must pick your new plan by 3:00 am ET on December 16 for coverage to start on January 1.
Though the SEP process gives you a few more days to pick a plan that starts in January, remember that insurers typically handle a surge of new enrollments at year end, increasing the risk that SEP applications filed at the last minute might encounter delays or mistakes.
Under the SEP process, you can also elect new coverage at any time for 60 days following your qualifying event.
That means you could pick a new plan as late as March 1  more than two months after Open Enrollment ends.
However, waiting this long means new coverage would begin as late as April 1, and you could be uninsured until then.
Finally, to use the SEP process, you must attest to your eligibility for the SEP and may be asked to provide documentation.
Be sure to save the notice from your current insurer, you may have to submit a copy of it to the Marketplace.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023

Q: I received financial assistance this year  a premium tax credit reduced my monthly health insurance premium.
I want to continue financial assistance next year.
What should I do?,""A: You should return to the Marketplace to update your application for financial assistance.
You can do this on your own, either by logging in to your account on the web site or by calling the Marketplace call center.
Or you can visit a Navigator or other in-person assister in your community.
Your Marketplace web site and call center will have contact information for in-person assisters near you.
If you dont update your application by the end of Open Enrollment, in most cases and in most states, the Marketplace will automatically adjust the amount of your premium tax credit for next year.
The automatic adjustment will be based on a rough inflation adjustment to your most recently reported income and on changes in the cost of the benchmark silver plan in the Marketplace next year.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_108,"Updating your application is a good idea because, chances are, the amount of premium tax credit you will be eligible for next year will be at least somewhat different from the current amount  and automatic adjustments made by the Marketplace may not fully reflect your situation.

Q: What happens if I dont update my application for financial assistance?,""A: If you live in a HealthCare.gov state and you dont update your application, in most cases, HealthCare.gov will automatically adjust the amount of your premium tax credit for next year.
If that turns out to be less than the amount youre actually eligible for, you will have to pay more premium each month than you otherwise would have had to, although you can receive a refund for the rest when you file your tax return at year end.
On the other hand, if the automatically adjusted premium tax credit amount turns out to be more than you are actually eligible for, you will have to repay all or part of the difference when you file your tax return.""
Q: Is there any reason the Marketplace wouldnt automatically adjust and continue my premium tax credit at renewal time?,""A: Yes.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023

If you buy coverage on your own and you first purchased your policy prior to March 23, 2010, it may be a grandfathered plan.
Some group plans offered by employers may also be grandfathered plans.

To retain grandfather status, the group plan cannot be significantly changed (that is, the employer cant significantly change covered benefits or cost sharing or the share of the plan premium that you are required to contribute.)
Because employer plans tend to change from year to year, most have already lost grandfather status or will lose it over time.
Employers with grandfathered group health plans are allowed to enroll new employees in the grandfathered plan.

Q: I received a Form 1095-A from the Marketplace.
What is that?,""A: Form 1095-A gives you information about the amount of advanced premium tax credit (APTC) that was paid during the year to your health plan in order to reduce your monthly premium.
This information was also reported to the IRS.
The APTC paid on your behalf during the year was based on the annual income you estimated you would earn when you signed up for Marketplace coverage.
Now you must file a federal income tax return to compute your actual income for that coverage year.
You will have to include Form 8962 with your return.
Instructions for this form will help you calculate how the APTC compares to the amount of premium tax credit you were eligible for.
If your actual income was lower than what you estimated, you are eligible for a larger premium tax credit and can claim the difference as a refund when you file your tax return.
If your income was higher than what you estimated, you are eligible for less premium tax credit and might have to pay back some or all of the difference when you file your return.""",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023

"",""A: You should contact the Marketplace to call the mistake to their attention and request a corrected form 1095-A.
Information on 1095-A is also reported to the IRS, so it is important that you get a corrected form before you file your income tax return.""
Q: I notice short-term policies are for sale outside of the Marketplace and they are cheaper than many other policies.
What is a short-term policy?,""A: As the name implies, a short-term health insurance policy offers coverage for a period of less than 12 months.
Many offer coverage for just 3 to 6 months.
Beyond that term, coverage generally can only be continued if the insurance company agrees.
This is sometimes called a non-guaranteed-renewable policy.
If youve made claims since you bought the short-term policy, the insurer can, and likely will refuse to continue coverage once the policy term ends.
In addition, short-term policies do not offer other protections found in Marketplace plans.
For example, short-term policies can exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions.
Short-term policies also typically do not cover essential health benefits such as prescription drugs, mental health care, substance abuse treatment, or maternity care.""
Q: Are short-term policies for sale in the Marketplace?,A: No.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_129,"Q: Are short-term policies for sale in the Marketplace?,A: No.
Only policies that meet ACA standards can be offered through the Marketplace.
Q: I am eligible for premium tax credits.
Can I apply those to a short-term policy?,A: No.
Only polices offered through the Marketplace are eligible for premium tax credits.
Q: Can a short-term policy turn me down if I have a pre-existing condition?,""A: Yes.
In general, the application for short-term policies will ask questions about your current health status and your health history.
Depending on your answers, if you have or have had a pre-existing condition you might be turned down or charged more.
How short-term policies treat you also depends on where you live.
A few states have passed laws to prohibit short-term policies from discriminating based on health status.""
Q: I heard about a short-term policy that has an option to renew.
Does that mean I can keep it even if I get sick after buying the policy?,""A: Maybe.
Under regulations issued by the Trump Administration, short-term policies can include renewal features that would enable people to continue coverage for up to three years.
However, before buying the policy, it would be important to know if the policy is renewable at your option or at the option of the insurance company.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_130,"If it is only renewable at the insurers option, you probably wouldnt be allowed to renew after you get sick.
It would also be very important to ask about how renewal premiums will be set.
Short-term policies in most states are allowed to set premiums, including renewal premiums, based on health status.
So if you do get sick, even if you have the right to renew the policy, you might not be able to afford to keep it.
Finally, short-term policies exclude pre-existing conditions.
At renewal, any health condition that you developed while covered under the policy can now be considered pre-existing, and so any care related to it wont be covered.""
""Q: Im pretty healthy now.
Does it make sense to buy a cheaper, short-term policy now, and then go back to a Marketplace policy if I do get sick?
"",""A: That strategy involves some risks.
First, if you do get sick while covered under a short-term policy, it might not cover benefits for the care you need.
For example, many short-term policies dont cover, or only provide limited coverage for prescription drugs.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_131,"For example, many short-term policies dont cover, or only provide limited coverage for prescription drugs.
Second, if you do get sick while covered under a short-term policy, the insurer can look back to see if your condition could be considered pre-existing.  For example, if you are diagnosed with cancer, the insurer might decide the cancer was growing in you before you bought the policy, even though you didnt know it, and so exclude coverage for the pre-existing condition.
Third, if you become seriously ill or injured while covered under a short-term policy, the insurer will most likely refuse to sell you new coverage once your policy term ends.
At that point, you might be able to buy a comprehensive policy through the Marketplace that wont turn you down, but these are only offered during annual Open Enrollment periods and new coverage wont start until January 1.
That means you could be  uninsured for many weeks or months before new Marketplace coverage begins.
Loss of coverage under a short-term policy will not make you eligible for a special enrollment period to buy Marketplace coverage mid-year.""
Q: I notice some insurers offer the option to buy two or more consecutive short-term policies with no medical underwriting required after the first application.
So does that mean Id be covered if I buy a sequence of short-term policies and then get sick?,""A: Probably not.
Each of the consecutive policies that you would buy would likely include a pre-existing condition exclusion.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_132,"Each of the consecutive policies that you would buy would likely include a pre-existing condition exclusion.
So, for example, if you are healthy enough to buy two consecutive short-term policies today, and then you get cancer while covered under the first policy, your cancer would be considered a pre-existing condition when the second policy starts and so would be excluded from coverage under the second policy.
By contrast, a qualified health plan sold through the Marketplace will never exclude pre-existing conditions.""
Q: Are short-term policies available everywhere?,""A: No.
Several states have prohibited the sale of short-term policies unless they follow all of the standards that apply to plans sold through the Marketplace  including standards prohibiting discrimination against people based on their pre-existing conditions.
These states include California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York; other states may consider similar action in the future.""
Q: An agent offered to sell me a policy that pays $100 per day when youre in the hospital.
Does that count as Minimum Essential Coverage?,""A: No.
Some types of coverage do not qualify as minimum essential coverage.
These include hospital indemnity policies (that pay a fixed dollar amount per day when you are hospitalized), discount plans, short-term nonrenewable policies, or plans that provide coverage only for a specific disease (i.e., cancer-only policies).",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_133,"Companies that sell these products, also called excepted benefits, are required to notify you if they dont qualify as minimum essential coverage.
If you receive such a notice, at a minimum, ask more questions about how the policy might cover pre-existing conditions or protect you from unaffordable medical bills.
Be aware that excepted benefit policies are not an equivalent substitute for Marketplace policies that meet Affordable Care Act standards.""
Q: Can I buy health insurance outside of the Marketplace that meets all ACA standards?,""A: Yes.
Many insurers that offer policies through the Marketplace also offer identical policies outside of the Marketplace, in the individual health insurance market.
These ACA-compliant policies also will meet all ACA standards.
They will cover essential health benefits; and they wont turn you down, charge you more, or limit coverage based on your pre-existing condition.
In addition, ACA-compliant policies will be offered only during Open Enrollment, or at other times during the year, only to people who are eligible for a special enrollment period (SEP).
Sometimes people prefer to buy outside of the Marketplace, for example, when they are sure they wont qualify for financial assistance.
However, many other policies that are not ACA-compliant are also for sale outside of the Marketplace, and this can make comparison-shopping more complicated.
Some signs that a health policy is not ACA-compliant include:",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_134,"The application asks questions about your health status or health history
The policy doesnt cover essential benefits, such as maternity care or prescription drugs

Plans that are not ACA-compliant, including short-term health insurance, may have lower premiums because they can exclude people with pre-existing conditions and offer more limited benefits.
If you are shopping outside of the Marketplace and you want an ACA-compliant policy, be sure to specify that to the insurer or broker youre working with.
Finally, even if you think you wont qualify for financial assistance, it still might be worthwhile to shop for coverage on the Marketplace.

Q: Who is eligible for Marketplace premium tax credits?,""A: Premium tax credits are available to U.S. citizens and lawfully present immigrants who purchase coverage in the Marketplace and who have income at least as high as 100% of the federal poverty level.
Premium tax credits are also available to lawfully residing immigrants with incomes below 100% of the poverty line who are not eligible for Medicaid because of their immigration status.

Q: Will recent changes to marketplace subsidies continue?,""A: Yes.

People with higher incomes  above 400% FPL (or just over $54,000 for an individual in 2023)  will also qualify for premium tax credits that will limit what they have to contribute to the benchmark silver plan to no more than 8.5% of income.
For example, the national average premium for the benchmark silver marketplace plan for a 60-year old in 2022 is $929 per month.

The Application will ask you basic information about yourself (and any family members who are applying for coverage with you) including your Social Security number and information about your citizenship or immigration status.
It will also ask employment and income information, including whats on your most recent income tax return.
Once youve submitted the application, the Marketplace will let you know if you qualify for help paying for Qualified Health Plans it offers.
It will also let you know if you (or any members of your family) may be eligible for coverage through Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023

In most cases the Marketplace will allocate the monthly tax credit in proportion to the premiums for the two plans.
Q: Do I have to file a federal income tax return to get a premium tax credit?
My income is so low Im not required to file a tax return.,""A: Yes.
Even if you dont earn enough to owe taxes, if you receive a premium tax credit in a year, you must file a federal income tax return for that year.

One challenge a young adult may face in her first year of financial independence from her parents can be verifying income.
The Marketplace verifies an applicants estimated income in real time, during the application process, using IRS data from recent federal income tax returns, and sometimes other data sources.
Because youve never filed an income tax return before, if the Marketplace cannot verify your income right away, you will receive a provisional (temporary) eligibility determination based on the income information you entered in your application.
The Marketplace will then give you a period of time (usually 90 days) to provide additional documentation of income.
Current pay stubs, bank deposit records, or other documentation may be appropriate, depending on your situation.""
""Q: If Ive not filed taxes in a prior year, how will the Marketplace determine my income?
"",""A: If an applicant did not file taxes in a prior year, income will be verified by the Marketplace through use of electronic wage data.
If the information cannot be verified electronically, the applicant may be asked to submit additional paper documentation within 90 days, such as pay stubs, a work contract or other verification of income.""

Q: Last year I tried applying for subsidized Marketplace plans but was told I wasnt eligible for financial help due to the family glitch. Has that been fixed?,""A: Yes, it has.
The so-called family glitch was a rule saying that family members of employed people are considered to have an offer of affordable employer-based coverage  and so are ineligible for financial help from the marketplace  if the employer offers  affordable self-only coverage to its workers but contributes little or nothing toward the added premium for family members.
The federal government changed this rule, starting in 2023, to require that family members are considered to have access to affordable coverage through a job-based plan if they are eligible for that coverage and required to contribute no more than 9.12% of household income toward the premium for that family coverage.

The general rule requires that people eligible for other MEC are not eligible for premium tax credits.
However, a special rule allows women who are already receiving APTC and who become pregnant and eligible for pregnancy-related Medicaid to choose whether to stay in their marketplace plan with APTC or enroll in the pregnancy-related Medicaid.

In all states, when your pregnancy and pregnancy-related Medicaid ends, you will be eligible for a special enrollment period (SEP) and can sign up for marketplace coverage and APTC at that time.

This is because insurers are prohibited from selling health insurance coverage that duplicates what you have under Medicare, if they know you are covered by Medicare.
If you are considering renewing a Marketplace policy after you turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare, there may be downsides to this choice.
First, your total costs could be higher with a Marketplace plan than with Medicare, even if your income is high enough that you are required to pay income-related premiums for Medicare coverage.
At your current income level in 2022, you would pay around $4,868 in annual Medicare premiums ($4,082 for Part B and $786, on average, for Part D.)

By comparison, premiums for a Marketplace policy will vary depending on where you live, your age, and the plan you choose.
In 2022, the national average premium for the lowest cost bronze plan for a 64-year-old was about $9,263 and the average annual deductible under bronze plans was about $7,000.
Most Marketplace participants pick silver plans.
On average, the premium for the benchmark silver plan for a 64-year-old was about $12,329 in 2022  much higher than the total premiums for Medicare  and the average silver plan deductible was about $4,800.
At age 64 at your income, you would qualify for modest premium subsidies in the Marketplace, but once you turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare, you would no longer be eligible for Marketplace subsidies.
Also keep in mind that the combination of Medicare plus a Medigap policy would offer you more comprehensive coverage with lower overall out-of-pocket costs than a Marketplace plan.

However, your mom might qualify for Medicaid under the current eligibility rules if her income and assets are low enough.
Under the current rules, Medicaid helps many low-income people on Medicare with their Medicare premiums and cost-sharing requirements, and may also cover some benefits that are not covered by Medicare, such as dental services and long-term services and supports.
Also, your mom might qualify for extra financial assistance to help with the cost of Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023

""Q: I am 54 and living with a permanent disability, and for the past 12 months I have been receiving Social Security disability insurance (SSDI) payments.
But I do not have health insurance.
I am required to wait another 12 months before I can go on Medicare due to the two-year waiting period for people receiving SSDI payments.
Am I eligible to purchase health insurance coverage from a Marketplace plan under the ACA?
Am I eligible for a premium tax credit?
And what about Medicaid?
"",""A: Yes, you are eligible to purchase coverage through the Marketplace, and if your income is at least 100% of the federal poverty level ($13,590 for an individual in 2023) you will qualify for premium tax credits to help make Marketplace coverage more affordable.
If you live in a state that has expanded its Medicaid program to cover adults under age 65 with incomes up to 138% of poverty (about $1,563 per month for an individual in 2023), you might also be eligible for this coverage, depending on your income.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023
cleaned_content.txt_282,"If you apply for and receive Marketplace coverage and subsidies, keep in mind that your eligibility for Marketplace subsidies will end when your Medicare Part A and Part B coverage automatically begins after the two-year waiting period.
At that point, you will have to pay the full price for your Marketplace coverage, but you could instead drop your Marketplace coverage and enroll in Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D.  If you keep both Medicare and Marketplace coverage, Medicare will be the primary payer.
Once your Medicare coverage begins, depending on your income, you may qualify for Medicaid in addition to Medicare or for extra help with premiums and cost sharing for your Part D prescription drug benefits.
A good place to turn for information about these programs and whether you might qualify is your local Social Security Administration office or the State Health Insurance Assistance Program in your state.

""Q: I am 66 years old, work for a large employer, and have excellent health insurance coverage through my job.
I am planning to keep working for a few more years and would like to keep the coverage that my employer offers.
How does the Marketplace affect me?
"",""A: It doesnt.
You can keep your employer-sponsored health insurance coverage as long as that is an option for you.
Since you are already eligible for Medicare because you are over age 65, you should sign up for Medicare when you stop working or if you lose your employer coverage before then.
Once you decide when you want to stop working, you should contact the Social Security Administration about how and when to enroll in Medicare to be sure you dont have a gap in coverage.""",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023

Can I sign up for a Marketplace plan?
"",""A: Yes, in general, people age 65 or older who are not entitled to premium-free Medicare can purchase health insurance coverage in the Marketplace (except undocumented immigrants).
If you sign up for a Marketplace plan, you will be eligible for premium tax credits to make the coverage in the Marketplace more affordable if your income is at least 100% of the federal poverty level ($13,590 for an individual in 2023).
Keep in mind that if you are able to continue working, you may be able to earn enough work history to qualify for premium-free Medicare in the future.
So another option for you to consider would be to sign up for Part A and Part B coverage when you turn 65 (you will have to pay a premium for both Part A and for Part B), and when you become eligible for premium-free Part A through your work history, you will then only have to pay a premium for Part B.""

cleaned_content.txt_285,"What happens when I go on Medicare?,""A: When you turn 65, you should sign up for Medicare and notify your Marketplace plan that you now qualify for Medicare coverage.
Your Marketplace coverage will not be cancelled automatically by your plan when you turn 65 and sign up for Medicare, but if you receive premium tax credits to help you pay for your Marketplace plan premium, your eligibility for these tax credits will end when your Medicare Part A coverage starts (people with Medicare are not eligible for these tax credits, and the premium tax credit can only be used for the purchase of Marketplace coverage, not Medicare).
If you choose to enroll in Medicare Part A and keep your Marketplace coverage, you will have to pay the full price for your Marketplace plan, and Medicare will be the primary payer.
If you were receiving financial assistance for your Marketplace coverage prior to signing up for Medicare, you will receive a letter in the mail from the Marketplace informing you that you are no longer eligible to receive this financial assistance since you are enrolled in Medicare Part A.
You should contact your Marketplace plan to make sure that your financial assistance is stopped when your Medicare coverage begins.
If you do not stop receiving the premium tax credit and other financial assistance for your Marketplace plan when your Medicare coverage begins, you may have to repay some or all of the amount of financial assistance you received for the months you had both types of coverage.",https://www.healthcare.gov/,ACA,5/11/2023

""Q: I am age 60 and have been receiving Social Security disability insurance (SSDI) payments for two years.
I recently received my Medicare card, and I would like to get coverage to supplement my Medicare Part A and Part B coverage.
I live in a state that does not require insurance companies to sell Medigap supplemental policies to people under age 65.
Can I purchase a Marketplace plan to supplement Medicare?
"",""A: No, companies that sell Marketplace plans are prohibited from selling these plans to you if they know you are covered by Medicare.
If you do not live in a state that requires insurance companies to sell Medigap policies to people under age 65, some insurance companies still may voluntarily sell Medigap policies to people under 65, although they will probably cost you more than Medigap policies sold to people age 65 and older.

Also keep in mind that if you sign up for a Marketplace plan, rather than enroll in Medicare Part B when you are first eligible to do so, and then later you decide to sign up for Medicare, you may be required to pay a penalty for delaying enrollment in Medicare Part B.
Your monthly Part B premium may go up 10% for each year that you could have had Part B but didnt.
