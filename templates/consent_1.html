                <p style="font-style: italic;">
                    The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the
                    public in
                    any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended only to provide
                    clarity to the
                    public regarding existing requirements under the law. This model consent form will not supersede any
                    State
                    Agent of Record, Broker of Record, or other form required by a QHP issuer for purposes of making
                    commission
                    payments to the proper agent or broker for assisting a particular consumer.

                <h5 style="margin-top: 20px;">Purpose Statement</h5>
                <p>
                    Registered agents and brokers assisting consumers apply for and enroll in Marketplace coverage must
                    document
                    consumer consent prior to accessing or updating their Marketplace information. CMS does not
                    prescribe the
                    manner in which agents and brokers must document consent. Instead, there are different formats that
                    may be
                    acceptable for agents and brokers to use to document consumer consent, such as via a recorded phone
                    call, text
                    message, email, electronic document with digital signatures, physical document with wet signatures,
                    etc. This
                    model consent form serves as an example for how agents and brokers may document consent via a
                    physical
                    document with wet signatures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since this model consent form is a best practice for obtaining consumer consent, you may tailor the
                    form to
                    address the needs of your specific business model in addition to meeting the CMS requirement to
                    document
                    consent from a consumer prior to assisting the consumer enroll in coverage in the Marketplace,
                    including prior
                    to conducting a person search. For example, if an Agency is involved, you may clarify specifically
                    who else within
                    the Agency other than the writing Agent is able to view and use the consumerâ€™s PII to assist the
                    writing Agent in
                    enrolling the consumer in Marketplace coverage for compliance, commissions, or other relevant
                    purposes as
                    you see fit.

                <p>I, <span id="printedName" style="font-weight: bolder;">{{ primary_household_name }}</span>, give my
                    permission to

                    identifiable information (PII)
                    for any purposes other than those listed above. The Agent will ensure that my PII is kept private

                    be true to the best of my knowledge. I understand that I do not have to share additional personal
                    information
                    about myself or my health with my Agent beyond what is required on the application for eligibility

                    modify my consent at any time by contacting the agent.
